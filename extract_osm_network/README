Open Street Maps (OSM) networks have problems and inconsistencies because they are built in an open source way by
many users. While they are an exceptionally useful resource, they need some pre-processing in order to standardise
them and "neaten them up". We use the SUMO software to do this.


Method:
-------

- Make sure SUMO is installed (https://sumo.dlr.de/index.html), and that it can run with:

  sumo --help

- Go to https://extract.bbbike.org/ and fill out the form on the left:

  Format = OSM XML 7z (xz)
  Name of area to extract = Any name (not important)
  Your email address = Any email (not important)

  Move the map to the desired location and then click "here" to create the bounding box. Adjust the box to select
  the region on the map that you want and click "Extract". This will take you to a new page where you should click
  on the "server status" link to get to the map download page. Click on "Enable auto refresh" and wait for your
  map to be created. Once it is ready, copy the link location for the download, and use wget to download the file,
  e.g.:

  wget https://download.bbbike.org/osm/extract/planet_12.672,52.463_12.85,52.54.osm.xz

- Unzip the ".osm.xz" file using:

  unxz planet_12.672,52.463_12.85,52.54.osm.xz

  Rename the output ".osm" file appropriately, e.g. "<CITY>.osm".

- Ensure that the file "osm.netccfg" is present in the same directory as the "<CITY>.osm" file. Edit the following 
  parameters in this file:

  osm-files = The name of the "<CITY>.osm" file that you downloaded.
  output-file = The desired name of the main output network xml file ("<CITY>.osm.net.xml").
  plain-output-prefix = The desired prefix for the other output files (<PREFIX>).

  The only other parameter that you may want to modify is:

  junctions.join-dist = The radius (or diameter?; m) to be used to merge multiple nodes at a junction.

  Note that the parameter "type-files" is set to "standard.typ.xml". This file should also be present in the same
  directory as the "<CITY>.osm" file, and it contains the default values to be used when the "<CITY>.osm" file is
  missing information for certain links/nodes.

- Run the "netconvert" program from SUMO on the "osm.netccfg" file:

  netconvert -c osm.netccfg

  If it finishes correctly, then the last two lines of the output should be:

  Writing network... done (91ms).
  Success.

  The run will generate the following output files (<PREFIX> is the prefix for the output files set in the
  previous step):

  <PREFIX>.con.xml = Connection file
  <PREFIX>.edg.xml = Edge file
  <PREFIX>.nod.xml = Node file
  <PREFIX>.tll.xml = Traffic light file
  <PREFIX>.typ.xml = Type file
  <CITY>.osm.net.xml = Main output network xml file that can be read into SUMO (and it uses the other output files)

  To open the file "<CITY>.osm.net.xml" in SUMO, use:

  sumo-gui <CITY>.osm.net.xml

- Next, run the following script on the edge and node files:

  /usr/share/sumo/tools/xml/xml2csv.py <PREFIX>.edg.xml
  /usr/share/sumo/tools/xml/xml2csv.py <PREFIX>.nod.xml

  This will generate the following output files:

  <PREFIX>.edg.csv = Edge file (csv format)
  <PREFIX>.nod.csv = Node file (csv format)

- Make sure that the parameters "country_name" and "city_name" are set correctly in the R script
  "create_final_network.R". Then run the script as follows:

  Rscript create_final_network.R

  This will create a file called "edges_valid_strongcon.txt".

- Run the "netconvert" program from SUMO on the "<CITY>.osm.net.xml" and "edges_valid_strongcon.txt" files:

  netconvert -s <CITY>.osm.net.xml --keep-edges.input-file edges_valid_strongcon.txt -o <CITY>.final.net.xml --proj.plain-geo true --geometry.remove true --plain-output-prefix <CITY>.final -v true

  If it finishes correctly, then the last two lines of the output should be:

  Writing network... done (91ms).
  Success.

  The run will generate the following output files:

  <CITY>.final.con.xml = Connection file
  <CITY>.final.edg.xml = Edge file
  <CITY>.final.nod.xml = Node file
  <CITY>.final.tll.xml = Traffic light file
  <CITY>.final.typ.xml = Type file
  <CITY>.final.net.xml = Main output network xml file that can be read into SUMO (and it uses the other output files)

- Finally, run the following script on the edge and node files:

  /usr/share/sumo/tools/xml/xml2csv.py <CITY>.final.edg.xml
  /usr/share/sumo/tools/xml/xml2csv.py <CITY>.final.nod.xml

  This will generate the following output files:

  <CITY>.final.edg.csv = Edge file (csv format)
  <CITY>.final.nod.csv = Node file (csv format)
